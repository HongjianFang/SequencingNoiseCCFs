# SequencingNoiseCCFs
Jupyter-notebook scripts for illustrating sequencing NCFs 

This Jupyter notebook shows examples of sequencing Noise Cross-correlation functions to improve the retrieval of Rayleigh waves and to investigate the temporal evolution of noise sources. Obspy (https://github.com/obspy/obspy) and Sequencer (https://github.com/dalya/Sequencer) are required before running the examples. Details about the method can be found in 

Hongjian Fang. (2023). Sequencing seismic noise correlations for improving surface wave retrieval and characterizing noise sources. SRL. in press.
